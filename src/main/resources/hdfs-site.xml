<!-- The reason why this is "pseudo distributed" configuration is because
    the name node and the (only) datanode are running on the the same
    machine. Normally there would be one name node and multiple data nodes
    running on separate machines.
    So this is why this pseudo distributed configuration has entries for
    the storage directories of both the name node and a data node. Normally
    we would see either one or the other depending on whether this machine
    is playing the namenode or datanode role.

    <!-- Replication of 1 actually means no replication. Replication refers
    to the duplication of datanode blocks not namenode meta-information.
    Name node meta information is not duplicated.
    However, I think the namenode needs this pararameter in order to know
    how to refer to the duplicated data blocks. I think therefore that
    the datanodes do not need the replication parameter (I need to check).
